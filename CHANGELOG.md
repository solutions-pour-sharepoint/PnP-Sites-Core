### Deprecated

- Marked SetDefaultContentTypeToList extensions methods on List and Web objects as deprecated. This method has some flaws. It was possible to use the ID of a content type at site level to set as a default content type in the list, IF a content type in that list was inheriting from the parent content type. The new method requires you to specify the actual content type that is associated with the list. It will not work to specify a parent content type id.
